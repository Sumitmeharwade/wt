Imagine you are developing a web application that manages a Hotel Booking System. The application has a database with two tables: Hotel and Customer. The Hotel table has columns like room no., custId, alloted(Yes/No), price. The Customer has columns such as custId,Customer name, Address, age. 

Your task is to create a Node.Js server that interacts with the database using SQL queries to perform the following operations:
1. Retrieve the list of all rooms in the hotel that are not alloted.
2. Retrieve list of all rooms in the hotel that are allottd to the customer with customer details.
3. Book the room to the new customer
4. Perform checkout operation of customer and make the room not allotted.


How would you structure the SQL  queries in your NodeJs application to achieve these operations efficiently?
